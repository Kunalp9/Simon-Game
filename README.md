# Simon-Game
An engaging coding project that brings the classic memory game to life in the digital realm!
The Simon game is a timeless memory challenge where players must repeat a sequence of colors and tones generated by the system. With each successful repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, putting the player's memory and concentration to the test. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the sequence resets.
